# DataCleanProject
Repo for the third Coursera Course in Data Science Track project
The code contained in this repository will display the steps taken to
 1. Merge the training and test sets into one data file
 2. Extract the measurements we are interested in
 3. Clean the names of the activities to be readable
 4. Clean the variable names to be more readable
 5. Create a final data set taking mean of interested variables by activity and subject

The codebook describes the variables used, and also describes select functions
